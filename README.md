### toastCE

ToastCE is an yet another toaster (notification) module, built for AngularJs. 
So what sets it apart from most other such modules? 
- It's abillity to readily addapt a scope, from the calling angular module and bind it to provided content HTML. 
- It's support for multichannel toasts (toast not just in one place, but where you need it). 
- It's visible timer feature (a must see). 
- It's simple and easily customisable layout. 
- It's simple straight forward architecture (any one used to angular will feel right at home).
